Executing on QEMU based on RISC-V processor:

In the assistedTrigger method, QEMU executes the userâ€™s program and stores the resulting execution trace. The proof generation module then reads this trace to produce a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), which is subsequently verified by the verifier program.
