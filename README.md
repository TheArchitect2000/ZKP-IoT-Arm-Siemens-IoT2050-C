# üöÄ Applying zk-IoT on Siemens SIMATIC IOT2050

This guide explains how to integrate **zk-IoT** with the **Siemens SIMATIC IOT2050** using the **FidesInnova** platform. The process involves device registration, commitment generation, proof submission, and verification on the blockchain.

---

## ‚úÖ Overview of the Process

1. **Register the IOT2050 Device:**  
   - Add the Siemens IOT2050 to your account on an IoT server within the FidesInnova platform.  

2. **Generate and Submit a Commitment:**  
   - Create a cryptographic commitment for the IOT2050 program.  
   - Submit the generated commitment to the FidesInnova network.  

3. **Generate and Submit a Proof:**  
   - Generate a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) for the IOT2050 program.  
   - Submit the proof to the FidesInnova network for verification.  

4. **Browse the Commitment and Verify the Proof:**  
   - Generate a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) for the IOT2050 program.  
   - Submit the proof to the FidesInnova network for verification.

# üö© Step 1: IOT2050 Registration

In this step, you‚Äôll add the IOT2050 device to your user account on an IoT server.  

1. **Create an Account:**  
   - Sign up on an IoT server like [**Motion Certified Panel**](https://panel.motioncertified.online).  

2. **Connect to Your IOT2050 Device:**  
   - Use SSH or a serial console to connect.  

3. **Install Git:**  
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install git -y

4. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FidesInnova/zkiot-siemens-simatic-iot2050.git
   cd zkiot-siemens-simatic-iot2050
   ```

# Step 2: Commitment Generation
In this step, you should generate a commitment for your program on IOT2050 and submit it on the Fidesinnova public network.

- Install necessary libraries on IOT2050
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y g++ libmosquitto-dev libmosquittopp-dev
```
- Edit the following items in `device_config.json` in the project root path:
```
{
  "class": 1,
  "iot_developer_name": "Fidesinnova",
  "iot_device_name": "Siemens_IOT2050",
  "device_hardware_version": "1.0",
  "firmware_version": "1.7",
  "code_block": [
    19723,
    19724
  ]
}
```
Update the following parameter:
```
"iot_developer_name": Based on the Company Name
"iot_device_name": Your IoT device name
"device_hardware_version"
"firmware_version"
```

- The project root path has a sample program, `program.cpp`. The commitment will be generated for this program.
- Execute the wizardry.sh script to generate a commitment.
```
./wizardry.sh
```
You can find the commitment at `data/program_commitment.json`
- Submit the commitment on Fidesinnova blockchain. To learn about this step, please follow: [A.8. Submit the commitment on blockchain](https://github.com/FidesInnova/zkiot-usage/blob/main/README_Program.md#a8-submit-the-commitment-on-blockchain)
  
# Step 3: Proof Generation
In this step, you should generate proofs by running the program on IOT2050 and submit it on the Fidesinnova public network.
- For this demo, you can use `wizardry.sh` script and choose option 3 to execute the program.
```
./wizardry.sh
```

# üåê Step 4: Browsing the Commitment and Verifying the Proofs

1. **Access the FidesInnova Explorer:**  
   - Open the [**FidesInnova Blockchain Explorer**](https://explorer.fidesinnova.io) to view your submitted commitments and proofs.  

2. **Review Your Data:**  
   - Use the search feature to find your device ID or transaction hash.  
   - Verify the details of your commitments and proofs to ensure successful submission.  

3. **Add Screenshots (Optional):**  
   - You can enhance this documentation by adding screenshots that show:  
     - The **Device List** section displaying your IOT2050.  
     - Submitted commitments and proofs on the FidesInnova Explorer.  
     - Blockchain transaction details for verification purposes.
